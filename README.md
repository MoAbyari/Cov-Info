# Project Title : CovInfo


## Current Version

v.01

## Description

CovInfo is a single-page app to track the NSW COVID-19 situation. NSW government APIs are used to fetch the latest COVID-19 info, then all data is visualised using chart.js and Mapbox.

This web app is built using Node.js for the back-end and Vue.js as a front-end framework. GeoJson of NSW states and suburbs were used to tile and colour code the map based on the current COVID cases.

## Inspiration

* To Represente updated info of NSW COVID-19 stats  
* To become more familiar with the challenges of a team environment throughout the development lifecycle.
